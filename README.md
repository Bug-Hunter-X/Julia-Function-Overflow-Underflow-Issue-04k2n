# Julia Function Overflow/Underflow Issue

This repository contains a Julia function demonstrating potential overflow and underflow issues. The `myfunction` does not explicitly handle cases where the result of `x^2` exceeds the maximum representable value (overflow) or is smaller than the minimum representable value (underflow).  This can lead to unexpected or incorrect results for very large or very small input values.

The solution demonstrates how to address this by adding checks and potentially using more appropriate data types.
